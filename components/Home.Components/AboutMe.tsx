        <span className="text-[#C1F025] font-semibold">Hi, I’m Daniel Igwe</span> — 
        a Nigerian from Imo State of Igbo heritage, raised for the most part in Lagos.  
        I am currently an undergraduate in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, holding
        the <em>Google Foundations of Cybersecurity</em> certification as well as
        <em> ISC² CC (Certified in Cybersecurity)</em>.

        My technical journey has led me through <strong>frontend</strong> and
        <strong> backend</strong> development, with hands-on experience in
        <strong> Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and 
        <strong> Next.js</strong>. I am steadily advancing as a
        <strong> full-stack developer</strong>. Along the way, I’ve built projects
        like a Blog API, Task Manager API, E-commerce API, and even a full UNN
        website clone. Professionally, I spent about a year as a Backend Developer
        at Remote Health, a telemedicine company, and trained in software
        engineering at ALX (2022).

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed space-y-4 mt-4">
        I’m seasoned in <em>Python, C, Bash scripting, Linux, HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript</em>, with a focus on secure, scalable, and efficient solutions.
        Beyond tech, I’m passionate about music — I play the drums and enjoy
        singing, watching soccer, and immersing myself in great music. I also
        aspire to broaden my musical skills when time permits.

        At my core, I am a believer and follower of our Lord Jesus Christ. I deeply
        value teamwork because working with people builds meaningful relationships,
        drives maximum productivity, and sparks outstanding ideas that grow into
        impactful solutions.
